# SMS Spam Classification 📱💬

Detect spam messages using various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques in Python.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (non-spam). You can find the dataset [here](https://your-dataset-link). It includes features like the text of the SMS messages and their corresponding labels.

## Tools Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Pandas
- 📈 Matplotlib
- 📉 Seaborn
- 📚 NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- 📊 WordCloud

## Approach
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and explore its structure and contents. Handle missing values and duplicates if any.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract features from the text data using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
4. **Model Building**: Train multiple classification models such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM (Support Vector Machines).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Selection**: Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and fine-tune its hyperparameters if necessary.
7. **Ensemble Methods**: Explore ensemble methods like Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier to combine the predictions of multiple models.
8. **Final Model Selection**: Select the final model with the highest performance for deployment.

## Analysis and Visualization
- Visualize the distribution of spam and ham messages.
- Explore the relationship between the length of messages and their classification.
- Generate word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in spam and ham messages.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
